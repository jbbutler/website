Welcome to my website! I am a PhD Candidate in UC Berkeley's Department of Statistics, advised by Jon McAuliffe and Fernando Pérez. I am broadly interested in applications of statistics to problems in environmental and earth science, particularly the use of extreme-value statistics techniques to understand the risk of extreme weather and climate events in a world of climate change.

Here, you can find more details about the various projects I've worked on in my research career, my teaching experience, my CV, as well as any contact information.

I am currently looking for postdocs beginning in Fall 2026. If you are looking for a postdoc and think I might be a good fit, please don't hesitate to reach out!
