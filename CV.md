**CASCADE Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)**  
     *Quantifying uncertainty in the rarity of extreme multivariate weather and climate events**\****  
      	*People: Jon McAuliffe, Michael Wehner*

* Develop nonparametric, data-driven method to quantify uncertainty in estimates of rare bivariate compound events in random systems, with application to extreme weather/climate events with bivariate drivers (e.g. wind speed and dryness in wildfires)
