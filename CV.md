## Research Projects

### CASCADE Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)
**Project: Quantifying uncertainty in the rarity of extreme multivariate weather and climate events** (Ongoing)
*People: Jon McAuliffe, Michael Wehner*
* Develop nonparametric, data-driven methods to quantify uncertainty in estimates of rare bivariate compound events in random systems.
* Applied to extreme weather/climate events with bivariate drivers (e.g., wind speed and dryness in wildfires).
* Utilize high-performance computing workflows and code optimization strategies to run simulations efficiently on NERSC supercomputers.

### Pérez Group, University of California, Berkeley
**Project: Associating storm characteristics with extreme impacts of Antarctic atmospheric rivers** (Ongoing)
*People: Michelle Maclennan, Fernando Pérez, Jon McAuliffe*
* Apply extreme value statistical methodology to quantitatively explore drivers of the most extreme atmospheric river-induced precipitation and temperature events in Antarctica.
* Develop specialized clustering strategies to catalog storm events.
* Create cloud-based and local workflows to extract weather/climate conditions from terabytes of MERRA-2 reanalysis data.
* Promote GitHub-based workflows to present and document data products using cutting-edge open science software tools.

**Project: Simulating impact of extreme temperature swings on ice melt** (Ongoing)
*People: Fernando Pérez*
* Integrate physical and statistical models to explore the time-to-melt distribution of an idealized block of ice subjected to stochastically generated temperatures.
* Analyze varying extremal properties to inform how global warming-induced climate change may exacerbate polar melt.

**Project: Exploring limitations of current geoscience software tools for sparse datasets**
*People: Fernando Pérez | Jan 2023 – May 2023*
* Tested xArray’s compatibility with sparse geoscience datasets.
* Communicated with xArray developers on improving the package’s sparse data API.

### Data and Analytics (DAS) Group, NERSC, LBNL
**Project: Software pipelines for AI-ready data at NERSC**
*People: Wahid Bhimji, Chris Harris*
* Developed software to catalog AI-ready datasets at NERSC for public use.
* Provided distributed data loaders and tested new job monitoring software.
* Goal: Lower technical barriers to running AI jobs and make data easier to find at NERSC.

### Weare Group, University of Chicago/NYU Collaboration
**Project: Analysis of a stochastic atmospheric blocking model using transition path theory**
*People: Justin Finkel, Dorian Abbot, Jonathan Weare | June 2020 – Aug 2021*
* Applied transition path theory, a theoretical math framework for analyzing dynamical systems, to stochastic atmospheric models.
* Predicted and characterized the dynamics of atmospheric blocks (phenomena causing heat waves, droughts, or floods).

### Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing Group, Argonne National Laboratory
**Project: Validating physicality of synthetic galaxy catalogs**
*People: Joe Hollowed, Salman Habib | June 2018 – Sept 2018*
* Programmed tests to evaluate the realism of the collaboration’s synthetic galaxy catalogs, ensuring simulated galaxies followed physical laws.

**Project: Quantifying uncertainty in deep-learning estimates of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing parameters**
*People: Nesar Ramachandra, Salman Habib | Sept 2018 – Aug 2021*
* Quantified uncertainty in deep learning estimates of physical parameters of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses using strategies such as dropout and Bayesian neural networks.

### International Institute of Nanotechnology REU Program, Northwestern University
**Project: Fabricating nanoscale devices to measure signatures of superconductivity**
*People: Patrick Krantz, Venkat Chandrasekhar | June 2019 – Aug 2019*
